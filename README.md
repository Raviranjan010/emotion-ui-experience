# 🎭 Mood-Based UI Changer (changes on mood)

An expressive and interactive **Mood-Based UI Changer** that transforms the entire website’s
look and feel based on the user’s selected mood.  
The UI dynamically adapts colors, animations, emojis, and content to create an emotional and immersive experience.

Built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend.

## 🌈 Live Concept

> Select your mood → Watch the UI instantly transform ✨  
A creative experiment blending **emotion + design + animation**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 😊 Mood selection buttons:
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Focused
  - Angry
- 🎨 Dynamic animated background gradients per mood
- 😄 Emoji animations (bounce, float, shake, pulse)
- 🎵 Mood-based music suggestions (text-based)
- 💬 Mood-specific motivational messages
- 🌙 Smooth UI transitions with micro-animations
- 💾 Mood preference saved using `localStorage`
- 🔄 Automatically restores last mood on page reload
- 📱 Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

- Emotion-driven UI (rare and creative concept)
- Heavy focus on **modern animations & UX**
- Clean separation of logic and styling
- No backend — fast, lightweight, and secure
- Perfect for portfolios, UI/UX showcases, and interviews

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Animated gradients, transitions, modern UI
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Mood logic & state management
- **localStorage API** – Persist user mood preference
